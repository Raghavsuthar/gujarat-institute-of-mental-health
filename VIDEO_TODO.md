## 📌 Clinical Safety & Licensing Standards for Videos
To safeguard patient safety and ensure clinical integrity:
1. **No Speculative or Unvetted Videos:** Video IDs must never be fabricated. Only officially verified, peer-reviewed, or professionally authored educational videos should be embedded.
2. **Recommended Sources:**
   - World Health Organization (WHO) Mental Health series
   - NIMHANS (National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bengaluru)
   - NHS UK / Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCPsych)
   - American Psychiatric Association (APA) Patient Education
   - MedCircle / Osmosis / Psych2Go (clinically verified episodes only)
   - Verified educational videos authored or narrated by licensed psychiatrists
3. **Strict Clinical Constraints:**
   - No depiction of self-harm methods or graphic crisis moments.
   - No fear-mongering regarding psychotropic medications.
   - Respects cultural sensitivities in Indian healthcare (multilingual availability in Hindi and Gujarati preferred whenever feasible).
4. **Privacy-Preserving Embed:**
   - All videos play via `YouTubeEmbed.tsx` using `youtube-nocookie.com`.
   - Uses click-to-play with lazy thumbnail facades (zero iframes or third-party cookies loaded prior to explicit user intent).

## 🔎 Audit Findings & Priority Queue (2026-10-20)

The condition library's video field was unpopulated for its core entries; the detail modal already supported click-to-play YouTube embeds, but the condition data had placeholder TODOs rather than curated IDs. The substance detail view did not yet render educational videos.

### Highest-priority gaps remaining

| Priority | Condition/topic | Current status | Next action |
|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | Bipolar disorder | Missing verified video | Select a patient-facing video from APA/NIMHANS/NHS; do not reuse general awareness content without review. |
| P1 | Panic disorder / panic attacks | Missing verified video | Find an evidence-based explainer that demystifies physical symptoms without implying all chest symptoms are anxiety. |
| P1 | Schizophrenia | Official NIMH recording linked externally | Confirm recording playback, captions and regional accessibility before considering direct embedding. |
| P1 | Alcohol use disorder | Integrated | NIH/NIAAA treatment-options video; ensure the text still emphasizes medically supervised withdrawal. |
| P1 | Opioid use disorder | Integrated | APA educational overview. |
| P2 | Tobacco/nicotine and cannabis use | Missing verified videos | Curate distinct, substance-specific education; avoid unverified detox or medication claims. |
| P2 | PTSD, dementia/delirium, postpartum depression | Missing verified videos | Prioritize trauma-informed and caregiver-safe content from recognized health organizations. |

**Verified embeds added in this change:** APA depression overview; ADAA anxiety overview; ADAA/IOCDF ERP overview; NIH/NIAAA alcohol-use-disorder treatment overview; APA opioid-use-disorder overview. Source pages confirmed the publisher, title and topic. These are English-language selections; localized versions remain a separate review task.

## 🛠️ How to Add a Video to Any Entry

When you have identified a high-quality educational video:
1. Copy the 11-character YouTube video ID (e.g., from `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ`, the ID is `dQw4w9WgXcQ`).
2. Open the corresponding data file (e.g., `src/data/treatments/cbt_erp_dbt.ts` or `src/data/conditions.ts`).
3. Add or update the property:
   ```typescript
   youtubeVideoId: 'dQw4w9WgXcQ',
   ```
   Or for multiple curated videos:
   ```typescript
   curatedVideoIds: ['dQw4w9WgXcQ', 'anotherVideoId'],
   ```
4. The system's `YouTubeEmbed` component will automatically render the video in `TreatmentsView`, `MedicationsView`, or `ConditionDetailModal` with a privacy-enhanced, click-to-play facade!
